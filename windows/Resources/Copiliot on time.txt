You can extract the hour, minute, and second in a similar way to how you extracted the year, month, and day. Here's an updated version of the function that includes these additional components:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

void getCurrentTimeAndDate() {
    time_t t;
    struct tm *tm_info;

    // Get the current time
    time(&t);
    tm_info = localtime(&t);

    // Extract year, month, day, hour, minute, and second
    int year = tm_info->tm_year + 1900;
    int month = tm_info->tm_mon + 1;
    int day = tm_info->tm_mday;
    int hour = tm_info->tm_hour;
    int minute = tm_info->tm_min;
    int second = tm_info->tm_sec;

    // Print the current time and date
    printf("Current Date and Time: %s", asctime(tm_info));
    printf("Year: %d\n", year);
    printf("Month: %d\n", month);
    printf("Day: %d\n", day);
    printf("Hour: %d\n", hour);
    printf("Minute: %d\n", minute);
    printf("Second: %d\n", second);
}

int main() {
    getCurrentTimeAndDate();
    return 0;
}

In this code:
- tm_info->tm_hour gives the hour (0-23).
- tm_info->tm_min gives the minute (0-59).
- tm_info->tm_sec gives the second (0-59).
This will print the current year, month, day, hour, minute, and second separately. Let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!
